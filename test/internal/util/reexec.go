/*
Tests may need to run code from a different process or scope (e.g., from within a container or uVM).
Rather than creating a dedicated binary per testcase/situtation, allow tests to re-exec
the current testing binary and only run a dedicated code block.
This leverages builtin `go test -run <regex>` functionality, consolidates code
so that the test and re-exec code can be updated in tandem, and removes the need to build
and manage additional utility binaries during testing.

Inspired by pipe tests in golang source:
https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:src/os/pipe_test.go;l=266-273;drc=0dfb22ed70749a2cd6d95ec6eee63bb213a940d4

Tests that re-exec themselves must set the [ReExecEnv] environment variable in the new process
in order to proprely skip testing setup and allow [RunInReExec] to function properly.

Additionally, [TestNameRegex] should passed to the testing binary's `-run` flag
in order to only run the current test case in the re-exec.

// match sub-tests against `B`.
