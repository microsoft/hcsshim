# This dockerfile builds a super barebones container image that includes a binary to do a single HNS operation to 
# validate that we can actually talk to HNS in a job container. As this is a huge usecase for job containers this is paramount 
# to test. The binary in the image will NOT function if this image is used for a normal windows container, both process and hypervisor isolated. 

# Irrelevant what image version we use for job containers as there's no container <-> host OS version restraint.
